    <h3>How does react work ?</h3>
    <p>
        ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of code known as components. React components work
        similarly to JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called properties or props. It's possible to
        have as many components as necessary without cluttering your code.
    </p>

    <h3>difference between props and state ?</h3>
    <p>
        Props are used to pass data from one component to another. The state is a local data storage that is local to
        the component only and cannot be passed to other components.
    </p>

    <h3>Why do we need to useEffect?</h3>
    <p>The motivation behind the introduction of useEffect Hook is to eliminate the side-effects of using class-based
        components. For example, tasks like updating the DOM, fetching data from API end-points, setting up
        subscriptions or timers, etc can be lead to unwarranted side-effects.</p>
